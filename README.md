# SocialWeb-Master-Thesis

This repository is dedicated for my master thesis "**Decentralization of centralized user data in social web applications**".

The project consists of complete implementation done to provide a Decentralized setting for social web platforms using **Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain** network. Complete deployment is done of a cluster of Raspberry Pi 3B Model. The code also provides a setup to evaluate the system for throughput, latency, scalability and network traffic. 

The end result is a a decentralized setting accomplished on a **permissioned Blockchain network providing tamper-proof and transparent records** distributed across the network where the unauthorized peers are entirely unaware of the data. It presents a safe and secure way to publish data in the ledger where users can share and access heterogeneous data, removing the need for a single authoritarian. **Semantic processing** is implemented to achieve interoperability in such heterogeneous data. Active **identification management** is implemented through which each user in the platform is recognizable and accountable for the transactions done by them. An efficient communication protocol is created by securely designing REST APIs. The **client application** is implemented to employ the APIs and provide essential facilities such as register user, add IoT sensor data, query private data and many more.
